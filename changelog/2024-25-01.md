# 1.0.1 (2024-25-01)

## 🚀 New Features

- `resend`
    - Order confirmation emails are now sent with every order. Order confirmations include the customer's name, items the customer ordered, quantity of each item, price per unit and the total amount owed.
    - Emails are sent with [resend](https://resend.com/)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- `order confirmation`
    - Found and resolved a bug where a user would add an item to their cart, remove item before checkout but the order confirmation would still include the previously removed item.
    - This bug also included probelems with the price, the total amount owed still reflected the previous price before removing the item
